## 🎯 Business Problem

The company lacks a structured way to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. The objective is to use K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups that can help improve targeted marketing and increase business revenue.
Businesses often treat all customers the same, using uniform marketing strategies without understanding differences in customer behavior. However, customers vary significantly in terms of purchasing patterns, income levels, and spending habits.
